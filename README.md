## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Challenge Title

A transportation company wants to assign its cars and planes to a number of drivers or pilots. Therefore, the idea of the application is to help them assign the vehicle, 
whether it is a car or a plane, to a qualified driver or pilot, so that planes must be assigned to a pilot and cars must be assigned to a driver.

#### steps Explaination
- Create a class for vehicles and define their properties such as (name, manufacturer, ID).
- Create a Class for the car so that it inherits from the Vehicles Class and define the characteristics of the car (type of car, gas or electric...).
- Create a Class for the Airplane so that it inherits from the Vehicles Class and define the characteristics of the plane (airplane type...).
- Create a Class with the name employee to represent employees and define its properties such as (name, ID, date of birth).
- Create a Driver Class that inherits from the Employee Class with additional driver properties defined such as licenseID.
- Create a Pilot class that inherits from the Employee class and defines additional pilot properties such as licenseID.
- Create a Reservation Class that contains the driver and his vehicle, such as (reservationDate, employeeId, vehiclesId, reservationID).
- After completing the above creation, define objects for three cars and two planes.
- Write a function that receives the employee's ID and the vehicle's ID and checks. If the employee is a pilot and the vehicle is a car,
  a message that they are not compatible will be printed. If the employee is a pilot and the vehicle is an airplane, an object will be created and stored in the Class reserved.
- Save all reservations into an array.
- Print the content of the array using the map function.
